    Build your vertical empire! 10kTower is a project created for the 10k Apart 2016 contest.  The objective is to create an online experience which degrades gracefully, functions without JS, and has an initial download size of under 10k.
    <br><br>
    This game was inspired by the classic tower building title SimTower.  Each type of floor has different needs and you'll have to listen to your tenants to create the perfect tower.<br><br>

        <b>Condo</b>
    </span>
    Cost: $80k
    <br><br>
    Condos are the lifeblood of your tower.  They are where your workers live, and they are an easy way to make quick profit.  However, unlike other units, condos must be repurchased from their owners, so be sure to keep your tenants happy unless you want to pay the price next quarter.  Condo tenants will complain if they are too close to commercial floors.

    <span class="f -o">
        <code>Office</code>
    </span>
    Cost: $40k
    <br><br>
    Offices provide jobs, as well as patrons for your commercial floors. Keep them happy with plenty of employees & lots of food options.
    <br class="lo">
    <span class="f -h">
        <tt>Hotel</tt>
    </span>
    Cost: $50k
    <br><br>
    Hotels are rented out nightly, unlike Offices & Condos which are rented by the quarter. Make sure to build enough Housekeeping units to keep them clean, and plenty of commercial floors to keep them busy.

    <span class="f -m">
        <i>Housekeeping</i>
    </span>
    Cost: $50k
    <br><br>
    Housekeeping units are required to keep your hotels clean.  If you don't have enough housekeeping, your guests will complain and your hotels won't fill up at night.
    <br class="lo">
    <span class="f -p">
        <i>Security</i>
    </span>
    Cost: $100k
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately, once your tower becomes big enough, crime will come with it.  Build security units to keep your tenants safe.
    <br class="lo">
    <span class="f -d">
        <i>Medical</i>
    </span>
    Cost: $500k
    <br><br>
    Along with security, make sure to build enough medical facilities to keep your tenants happy and healthy.
    <br class="lo">
    <span class="f -r">
        <strong>Restaurant</strong>
    </span>
    Cost: $100k
    <br><br>
    The least expensive commercial unit - restaurants are essential and provide places for your tenants and workers to eat. The happier your restaurants, the more revenue they'll make!
    <br class="lo">
    <span class="f -s">
        <strong>Shop</strong>
    </span>
    Cost: $100k
    <br><br>
    Your second retail unit, shops need more customers to stay in business, but if you keep the traffic flowing they will earn more traffic compared to restaurants.
    <br class="lo">
    <span class="f -t">
        <strong>Theatre</strong>
    </span>
    Cost: $500k
    <br><br>
    The most expensive retail unit for the busiest towers.  You'll need a lot of tenants to keep this profitable - under 1000 tenants and you won't get enough business.
