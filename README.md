## 10kTower ##

Build your vertical empire! 10kTower is a project created for the [10k Apart 2016](https://a-k-apart.com) contest.  The objective is to create an online experience which degrades gracefully, functions without JS, and has an initial download size of under 10k.

This game was inspired by the classic tower building title SimTower.  Each type of floor has different needs and you'll have to listen to your tenants to create the perfect tower.
